          <h2>United Kingdom Matters Only</h2>
          <p>
            This guide applies to instructing tax expert witnesses in UK tax disputes only: HMRC assessments and investigations, First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal appeals, and civil proceedings where English, Welsh, Scottish, or Northern Irish tax law and tribunal rules govern expert evidence. We do not cover non-UK tax jurisdictions.
          </p>

          <h2>For Tax Litigation Counsel</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the technical tax issue</strong>, VAT, transfer pricing, IHT, CGT, ERS, SDLT, corporate avoidance, or professional negligence</li>
            <li><strong>Determine expert type</strong>, Does the case need a tax technical expert, a forensic accountant, or both? See <Link href="/what-is-a-tax-expert-witness">tax expert vs forensic accountant</Link></li>
            <li><strong>Check FTT category</strong>, Standard and complex track cases typically require expert evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare instructions</strong>, Specific technical questions to address; CPR Part 35 format required; include summary of material facts</li>
            <li><strong>Provide documents</strong>, HMRC assessment, relevant correspondence, tax returns, financial records, and any HMRC reconstruction report</li>
            <li><strong>Expert assessment</strong>, Expert reviews HMRC&apos;s position and advises on strength of challenge</li>
            <li><strong>Report and hearing</strong>, CPR Part 35 report, response to written questions, supplemental report if needed, hearing attendance</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>For Forensic Accountants</h2>
          <p>
            Instruct a separate tax expert when the case raises technical tax analysis questions beyond forensic accounting expertise. Common scenarios include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HMRC reconstruction produces a financial figure, but is the correct tax treatment applied to that figure?</li>
            <li>POCA benefit calculation includes tax elements requiring technical analysis</li>
            <li>Professional negligence claim requires assessment of whether tax advice was correct</li>
            <li>Transfer pricing dispute requires arm&apos;s length analysis beyond financial accounting</li>
            <li>VAT MTIC case requires knowledge test analysis, not just transaction tracing</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Red Flags When Selecting an Expert</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>No active tax practice, tax law changes constantly</li>
            <li>No FTT testimony history in the relevant tax area</li>
            <li>Cannot explain the disputed tax issue clearly to a non-specialist</li>
            <li>Unfamiliar with current HMRC practice and recent tribunal decisions</li>
            <li>Prior adverse judicial comments on their expert evidence</li>
          </ul>
