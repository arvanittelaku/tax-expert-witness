          <h2>The UK Tax Dispute Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            The First-tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) handles appeals against HMRC decisions on income tax, PAYE, corporation tax, CGT, NIC, IHT, VAT, excise duty, and customs duty. Tax disputes range from straightforward assessment challenges to complex multi-million pound transfer pricing and MTIC fraud proceedings. At every level, the question of whether independent expert evidence is required, and what type of expert, is a critical strategic decision for instructing solicitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            A tax expert witness is distinct from a forensic accountant. Where the dispute turns on whether the correct tax analysis was applied, whether HMRC&apos;s methodology is sound, or what the correct tax position should be, a tax technical expert is required. Where the dispute turns on financial reconstruction, business valuation, or quantification of undeclared income, a forensic accountant may be needed, and in many complex HMRC investigations, both disciplines work together.
          </p>

          <h2>The First-tier Tribunal (Tax)</h2>
          <p>
            The FTT process requires careful gathering and organisation of documentary evidence including invoices, contracts, emails, accounting records, and due diligence materials, with witness evidence explaining the decisions taken by directors, accountants, or advisers, and legal submissions placing the evidence in the context of statutory provisions, HMRC guidance, and relevant case law.
          </p>
          <p>
            From filing notice of appeal to FTT hearing typically takes 2–3 years, making early instruction of expert witnesses essential to allow adequate preparation time. Solicitors should instruct experts at case assessment stage, not when the hearing date is listed.{" "}

          </p>

          <h2>When Does the FTT Need Expert Evidence?</h2>
          <p>Expert evidence is needed in FTT proceedings where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A technical accounting or valuation question requires specialist evidence beyond the parties&apos; own accounts</li>
            <li>HMRC&apos;s reconstruction methodology is challenged</li>
            <li>A valuation (business, shares, property) is central to the tax liability</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Knowledge Test in VAT MTIC Cases</h2>
          <p>
            In VAT fraud cases, judgments such as Mobilx Ltd v HMRC [2010] confirm that HMRC must prove actual or constructive knowledge before denying input tax, requiring careful alignment of evidence with legal principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tax expert witness assesses whether the knowledge test is met, analysing the due diligence performed, the red flags present, and whether a reasonable business in the same position would have known the transactions were connected to fraud.{" "}

          </p>

          <h2>Transfer Pricing: The Arm&apos;s Length Principle</h2>
          <p>
            Transfer pricing disputes arise when HMRC challenges the pricing of transactions between connected parties, arguing the price was not at arm&apos;s length and adjusting the taxable profits. Tax expert witnesses provide independent analysis of comparable uncontrolled transactions (CUTs), profit level indicators, the most appropriate transfer pricing method, and OECD BEPS compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            With HMRC&apos;s transfer pricing yield increasing dramatically in 2025, early expert instruction in transfer pricing enquiries is essential.{" "}

          </p>

          <h2>IHT and CGT Valuation Disputes</h2>
          <p>
            Where the tax liability depends on the value of shares, business interests, or property at a specific date, the tax expert witness addresses both the correct valuation methodology and whether the value HMRC&apos;s Shares & Assets Valuation (SAV) has adopted is defensible.{" "}

          </p>

          <h2>Professional Negligence in Tax Advice</h2>
          <p>
            Tax professional negligence claims require a tax expert witness to assess the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent tax adviser, whether the advice given fell below that standard, the correct advice that should have been given (the but-for position), and the additional tax liability or loss caused by the negligent advice.{" "}

          <h2>2025–2026 Enforcement Context</h2>
          <p>
            The current tax disputes landscape is shaped by three significant developments: HMRC&apos;s dramatically increased transfer pricing yield, the ongoing debate about COP9 methodology (highlighted by judicial scrutiny including HMRC v Harte [2026]), and continued MTIC VAT enforcement with successful expert challenges cancelling substantial assessments. Tax expert evidence is increasingly decisive in tribunal outcomes.{" "}
